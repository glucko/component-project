# Deck

This is a modelling of a deck of cards. It is made in accordance to the OSU
discipline, which means that instead of just being a single class, it is built
off of many, including an abstract class, which allows it to be implemented with
a different backend representation without rewriting all the methods, instead
only rewriting select kernel methods.
